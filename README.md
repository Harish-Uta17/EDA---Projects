# EDA & Feature Engineering Projects ðŸ“Š

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering (FE) projects**. Each project demonstrates how I analyzed and cleaned datasets, performed feature transformations, and prepared data for machine learning models.

## Whatâ€™s Inside
- **Data Cleaning** â€“ Handling missing values, correcting data types, and preprocessing text/numeric columns.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Visualizing data distributions, relationships, and patterns using Python libraries.  
- **Feature Engineering (FE)** â€“ Transforming features, encoding categorical variables, and creating new meaningful features.  
- **Datasets** â€“ Cleaned datasets ready for modeling or further analysis.

## Technologies & Libraries Used
- **Python** â€“ Core programming language  
- **Pandas & NumPy** â€“ Data manipulation and analysis  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** â€“ Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ Preprocessing, encoding, and feature engineering

## Purpose
This repository is a showcase of my **data science skills**, specifically in:  
- Understanding and analyzing data  
- Cleaning and transforming datasets  
- Applying feature engineering techniques for predictive modeling
